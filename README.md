# Lyric Generator

https://lyric-generator.streamlit.app/

Streamlit app for generating lyrics using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model. Fine tuned on a curated dataset of lyrics that I consider good. Will often have broken song structure and unrelated sections, however it can generate some absolute gems of phrases, lines and even whole sections every once in a while. Probably more useful as a tool for lyrical inspiration than a standalone lyric generator. 

Play around with the parameters to get results to suit your needs:

- Lower repetition penalty will make the lyrics read like a james brown song

- Higher repetition penalty will make it read like a short story

- Temperature affects the randomness of token selection

- Top-k and Top-p will filter the pool of tokens to select from
